**Cap is an easy machine from Hack The Box.**

### Enumeration 

`nmap -sC -sV -oG nmap_basic_oG 10.10.10.245`

```
21/tcp open  ftp     vsftpd 3.0.3
22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.2 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
| ssh-hostkey:

```

FTP, SSH, and HTTP. I'll take a look at the webpage first.

It looks like a simple security dashboard.

Looking at the side menu, there's a few different tools to use. The PCAP generator seems interesting.

After running the PCAP generator, it assigns it the filename `1.pcap` and lets me download it. I wonder if there's a `0.pcap`...

There is! Let's download that and open it in Wireshark.

There's a few different data streams to look into, but the most revealing is an FTP login attempt. I can see a user, `nathan`, logging in to the FTP service and his password.

`nathan:Buck3tH4TF0RM3!`

So now I have credentials, let's try them on the open SSH service.

Looks like a case of password reuse and now I've got a shell.

### Privilege Escalation

After running `linpeas` to enumerate possible vectors for privilege escalation, I find some information about Linux capabilities.

Capabilities are a more granular way of assigning different privileges to certain processes or files. You can enumerate them with `getcap -r / 2>/dev/null`.

In this case, the `python3.8` binary has been assigned the SUID capability, which means I can run it as the file's owner.

The `root` user is the owner of this binary, so privilege escalation should be trivial.

`/usr/bin/python3.8 -c 'import os; os.setuid(0); os.system("/bin/bash")'`
