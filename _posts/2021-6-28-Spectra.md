**Spectra is an easy machine from Hack The Box.**

### Enumeration

The OS version for this box is unknown, so let's see if `nmap` returns anything in that vein.

```
PORT     STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp   open  ssh     OpenSSH 8.1 (protocol 2.0)

```

No OS information, but I can see MySQL running, in addition to a web server and SSH.

The homepage doesn't reveal much, and the "Test" link throws a "database connection" error, but reveals a "/testing" directory.
Clicking through to "Software Issue Tracker" brings up the main WordPress page.

If I go to "/testing" I can see the directory listing of WordPress files.

Trying to view `wp-config.php` throws a database connection error, but `wp-config.php.save` brings up a blank page. Viewing the source of the page reveals its contents:

```
// ** MySQL settings - You can get this info from your web host ** //
/** The name of the database for WordPress */
define( 'DB_NAME', 'dev' );

/** MySQL database username */
define( 'DB_USER', 'devtest' );

/** MySQL database password */
define( 'DB_PASSWORD', 'devteam01' );

/** MySQL hostname */
define( 'DB_HOST', 'localhost' );
```

Looks like I have a MySQL database name and associated creds.
I ran WPScan to enumerate WordPress further and found a single user, `administrator`, who is the author of the only post on the site.
I tried to login with `administrator:devteam01` to the "wp-admin" panel, and got in!

### Initial Foothold
I did some searching around and found an [exploit](https://github.com/wetw0rk/malicious-wordpress-plugin) I can use.
I can use this script to generate a malicious plugin, upload that to the admin panel, and, once the plugin is activated, I should get a reverse shell.

Got a shell! Time to do some digging.

I am on as the user `nginx` with not a whole lot of functionality. Looking at the `/home` directory, there are a few users I may be able to use to elevate my privileges.
I didn't find anything of value in the SQL server, but maybe `linPEAS` will find something.
After transferring `linPEAS` from my machine to `spectra` and running the script, I might have found another password:

```
/etc/autologin/passwd
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 19 Feb  3 16:43 /etc/autologin/passwd
SummerHereWeCome!!
```

`autologin` is using this password to log a particular user in, but I'm not sure who. I'll create a list of users and use `hydra` to test that password against each of them via SSH.

`katie` is the lucky winner.

SSH in as `katie` and I've found a user flag.

### Privilege Escalation

Now that I'm on as a "real" user, with a real terminal, I'll run `sudo -l` to see what permissions `katie` has.
```
User katie may run the following commands on spectra:
    (ALL) SETENV: NOPASSWD: /sbin/initctl
```

`katie` can run `/sbin/initctl` as `root`. Let's take a look at the different jobs they might have access to.
`katie` is a member of the `developers` group:

It appears the `developers` group has write access to quite a few jobs. I can edit one of these and then execute `initctl` as `root` to elevate my privileges.

Open `test.conf`, add a line to enable the SUID on `/bin/bash`, and restart the job with `sudo /sbin/initctl start test`.

Drop into a new shell, and I am indeed `root`. 
The `/bin/bash -p` allows me to spawn a new shell with the effective UID of `root`, as opposed to the real UID of `katie`.
